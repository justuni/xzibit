xzibit is a per-window VNC system.
Its development is supported by Collabora Ltd.

A. Instructions:

1. make sure you have wmctrl, xlogo, libvncserver,
   Xephyr, and gtk-vnc installed.
   (some of these are checked by autotools,
    some of them aren't yet.)
2. run ./autogen.sh
3. run make install
4. if your mutter is expecting plugins in /usr/lib, you
   may need to run

       sudo cp /usr/local/lib/mutter/plugins/xzibit.so \
           /usr/lib/mutter/plugins/
 
   (this should really be done in autotools)

5. use gconf-editor to set
       /apps/mutter/general/clutter_plugins
   to a list containing the string
       xzibit

6. run xzibit-demo

That's all to be going on with.

B. More details:

xzibit-demo calls xzibit-run with some useful arguments.
xzibit-run launches two Xephyrs, :3 and :4, and sets
up a mutter instance on both of them.  It then runs
xzibit-autoshare on :3.  xzibit-autoshare automatically
sets itself as shared after a few seconds.  This should
cause it to appear on :4 as well.

For more information, read the protocol document in doc/.

C. What's left to do:

Vital:

 * Telepathy support.  At present it only works across
   the loopback interface.  The next release will
   send the windows over Tubes.
 * Getting xinput2 support fully working, so we can fake
   mouse clicks and keypresses on arbitrary windows.
 * "Doppelganger" pointers, i.e. ones which track the
   movement on the other display.

Less important:

 * Audio support.  This is partly-written in a branch.
