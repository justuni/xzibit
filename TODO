 - Think whether we should really have the names
   "client_fd" and "server_fd" the way round that they are.
 - client_fd should be a hash table mapping xzibit IDs to
   FDs, not a singleton.  At the same time, consider how
   we'll deal with multiple remote xzibits as well.
 - Move all the postponed properties code out of xzibit-plugin
   into xzibit-rfb-client.
